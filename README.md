# Circle ⚫📐

This repository called __Circle__ contains a program created in Java. This program represents a circle at origin (0,0), which through a series of methods in the 'Circle5' class is manipulated to be moved and resized. The area and perimeter can also be calculated, and it can be combined with another circle. This program is a very effective way to practice working with instance variables by constantly changing them through the several methods. Some of the concepts used in this repository may include:
- Instance Variables
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers
- Private Methods
- Mathematical Operations
